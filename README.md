# 11ty + Parcel

Like [11ty](https://11ty.dev/docs)?  
Sweet! So do I.

Also like [Parcel](https://parceljs.org/docs/)?  
Can't blame you. I do too.

This is like a double rainbow of frontend tools in my view.

To use, clone this repo and run:

`npm install`  
`npm run dev`

...and let Parcel run your 11ty
